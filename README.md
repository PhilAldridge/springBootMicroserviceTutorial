This code is the result of following the tutorial found (here)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPPhcU7oWDU]. In the process of working on this project, I learned about:
- Spring Boot, how to configure and initialize a Spring Boot project.
- Creating a mongoDB and mySQL server using Spring Boot.
- How to get servers to communicate with each other.
- Service discovery using Netflix Eureka
- Using Spring Cloud Gateway to implement an API Gateway
- How to secure services using Keycloak
- How to implement a circuit breaker
- Event driven architecture using Kafka
- How to dockerize the microservices project
- Using Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the microservices.
